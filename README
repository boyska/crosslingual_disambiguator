The goal of this project is to implement a simple cross-lingual WordSense
Disambiguator that takes data from EuroParl, parse them, postprocess them in
order to reduce the noise and convert them to ARFF file format, so that Weka
can use them to build a classifier.

Note that a classifier can disambiguate just _one_ word.

DEPENDENCIES:
* commons-logging
* commons-configuration
* snowball (for stemming) [optional with minor code changes]
